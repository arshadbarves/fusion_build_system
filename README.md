# Fusion Build System (FBS) Design

## Overview

Fusion Build System (FBS) is a comprehensive build automation tool designed to streamline and optimize the process of compiling, linking, and packaging software projects. Written in Rust, FBS emphasizes performance, extensibility, and user-friendly interfaces, making it an ideal solution for projects of any scale and complexity.

## Core Components

### Build Graph
- Models the project structure and dependencies using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- Captures relationships between modules, libraries, and executables.

### Task Scheduler
- Manages the execution of build tasks with parallel processing for faster builds.
- Ensures optimal execution order based on task dependencies.

### Plugin System
- Allows for easy extension with custom build steps, tools, and integrations.

### Configuration Manager
- Manages project and build configurations using hierarchical configuration files (global, project-specific, user-specific).

### Dependency Resolver
- Manages external dependencies and third-party libraries.
- Supports various package managers and version control systems.

## Key Features

### Automated Project Generation
- Scans project directory structure to generate initial build configurations.
- Automatically infers dependencies and module relationships.

### Incremental Builds
- Tracks file changes to rebuild only affected components.
- Utilizes caching for faster subsequent builds.

### Cross-Platform Support
- Abstracts platform-specific details for a unified build process across different operating systems and architectures.

### Build Profiling and Optimization
- Analyzes build times and resource usage.
- Provides suggestions for build optimizations.

### Integrated Testing Framework
- Supports unit tests, integration tests, and custom test suites.
- Provides detailed test result analysis and reporting.

### Documentation Generation
- Automatically generates project documentation from source code and comments.
- Supports custom documentation templates.

## User Interface

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Provides a powerful and scriptable interface for advanced users.
- Supports all build system features and configurations.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Offers an intuitive interface for managing projects and build configurations.
- Visualizes the build graph and dependency relationships.

### IDE Integration
- Provides plugins for popular IDEs (Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs).
- Seamlessly integrates with existing development workflows.

## Extensibility

### Custom Build Steps
- Allows users to define custom build steps using a simple scripting language.
- Supports integration with external tools and processes.

### Build Events
- Provides hooks for pre-build, post-build, and custom events.
- Enables complex build workflows and automation.

### Template System
- Offers customizable templates for projects, modules, and build configurations.
- Supports rapid project setup and consistent structure across teams.

## Performance Optimizations

### Distributed Builds
- Supports building across multiple machines for large projects.
- Implements intelligent load balancing and task distribution.

### Caching and Reuse
- Implements aggressive caching of intermediate build artifacts.
- Supports sharing cached results across team members and CI/CD pipelines.

### On-Demand Compilation
- Compiles only the necessary components for the current target.
- Reduces build times for large projects with multiple targets.

## Reporting and Analytics

### Build Reports
- Generates detailed reports on build times, resource usage, and errors.
- Provides historical data for tracking build performance over time.

### Dependency Analysis
- Visualizes module dependencies and suggests optimizations.
- Identifies circular dependencies and other potential issues.

### Code Quality Integration
- Integrates with code analysis tools to provide quality metrics during the build process.
- Supports custom quality gates and build failure conditions.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Provides easy integration with popular CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
- Supports automated builds, testing, and deployment.

### Artifact Management
- Manages build artifacts for different configurations and platforms.
- Supports versioning and easy retrieval of previous builds.

## Security and Compliance

### Dependency Scanning
- Scans third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Provides reports and alerts for security issues.

### License Compliance
- Tracks and reports on licenses of used libraries and tools.
- Ensures compliance with open-source licenses and company policies.

## Customization and Flexibility

### Build Profiles
- Supports custom build profiles for different use cases (development, testing, production).
- Allows fine-grained control over compilation flags, optimizations, and included modules.

### Module System
- Implements a flexible module system for organizing code and dependencies.
- Supports conditional compilation and platform-specific modules.

### Scripting Language
- Provides a domain-specific language for advanced build configurations.
- Allows users to define complex build logic and custom rules.
